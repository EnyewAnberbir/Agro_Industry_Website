                            to the crops to increase their productivity. These are used by the farmers daily to increase the

              is the main component of chlorophyll, which maintains balance during photosynthesis. It is also part of
              plant amino acids and forms proteins. Nitrogen fertilizers improve the yield and quality of agricultural

              of fertilizer depends upon effective phosphorus content, methods of fertilizing, properties of soil and
              crop strains. Phosphorus found in the protoplasm of the cell plays an important role in cell growth and
              proliferation. The phosphorus fertilizer is beneficial for the growth of roots of the plants.</p>

              soils. For that reason mixed fertilizers containing two or more materials in suitable proportions are 
              used according to the needs of different soils. Mixtures usually fulfill the nutrient deficiencies in
              a more balanced manner and require less labour to apply than different fertilizers used separately.</p>

              reproductive structure in the plant flower. a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants 
              that is formed from the ovary after flowering.The outer layer, often edible, of most fruits is called 
              the pericarp. Typically formed from the ovary, it surrounds the seeds; in some species, however, other
              structural tissues contribute to or form the edible portion.One of the main functions of a fruit is 
              to spread the seeds and allow the plant to reproduce. Therefore, all flowering plants produce fruit, 
              regardless of whether the fruit is edible, sweet, or soft.</p>
