                    <p>Enyew Agro Campany had established before two years and One of the major key factors for 
                        bringing the idea is the availablity of agricultural products. In our country the basic problem 
                        for the country is less availablity  of the agricultural product because of there is less methods to
                        address the whole country. When Enyew Agro industry built there are one manager and two employees and 
                        with in small room.After we stayed for three month we increase the employees to seven employees and we pass 
                        different problems and obstacles to reach our current level
